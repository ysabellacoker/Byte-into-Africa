            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>My goal is to use my coding and cooking skills to create an online African cookbook for African students living away from home. This cookbook will help them learn how to cook traditional dishes from their home countries, so they can stay connected to their culture and enjoy familiar meals.</p>

            <h2>Why did I choose this?</h2>
            <p>I am an international student myself, and although I don’t get homesick, I do sometimes miss the comfort of a home-cooked meal. Fortunately for me, I have family who don’t live too far, so I am able to visit them while enjoying a meal from home. This then got me thinking about students who don’t have the same privilege as me. I wasn’t able to find any authentic recipe websites because most of the recipes come from people who don’t regularly cook African meals. My focus on solely African cuisine is due to how different it is from all other cuisines in the world. There is nothing similar. While sharing recipes, I also plan to dive into the cultural context. There is a lot of culture infused in African cuisine, and I plan to share these stories with the world.</p>

            <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
            <p>Imagine being an international student living far from home, craving the comforting taste of a traditional dish, but unsure how to recreate it in your new kitchen. Byte into Africa is here to solve that problem. My project aims to create a digital African cookbook that empowers African students to reconnect with their roots through food. By combining my skills in coding and cooking, I’m building an online platform that not only shares authentic recipes from across the continent but also preserves and showcases Africa’s rich culinary heritage. This cookbook will serve as a bridge, making African cuisine accessible to a global audience while allowing students to keep their culture alive, no matter where they are. So, let’s stir up some memories, sprinkle in some tradition, and take a bite out of Africa—one recipe at a time. I’m Ysa, and I’m excited to help bring the taste of my home to your fingertips!</p>
