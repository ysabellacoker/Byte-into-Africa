  <h1>Desserts and Drinks</h1>
  <p>Delight in these sweet treats from Ethiopia! Whether you're craving something light and fluffy like Mandazi or a spiced, buttery snack like Chiko, these desserts are perfect for any occasion.</p>
</section>

<main class="section">
  <section class="recipe">
    <h2>Mandazi</h2>
    <p>Mandazi, also known as African donuts, are deliciously light, fluffy, and infused with aromatic cardamom and cinnamon. These fried pastries are perfect for breakfast, as a snack, or paired with your favorite tea or coffee. Enjoy them plain or dusted with powdered sugar.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
      <li>½ cup warm water (about 110°F)</li>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cardamom</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>½ cup coconut milk</li>
      <li>½ cup sugar</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>In a small bowl, combine the yeast and warm water. Stir and let sit for 5 minutes until the yeast dissolves. In the bowl of a mixer, add flour, salt, cardamom, and cinnamon. Mix well, then add vegetable oil, egg, coconut milk, sugar, and the yeast mixture. Using the dough hook, knead until the dough is smooth and no longer sticky, adding extra flour if necessary.</p>
    <p>Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rise for about 1 hour. Once it has risen, divide the dough into 6 portions. Roll each piece out to about 1 cm (less than ½ inch) thick and cut into triangles or your preferred shape.</p>
    <p>Heat 2-3 inches of vegetable oil in a deep pan to 350°F. If you don't have a thermometer, drop in a small piece of dough—if it sizzles and floats, the oil is ready. Fry the dough in batches, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan, and cook until golden brown on both sides. Transfer the cooked Mandazi to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil. Repeat with the remaining dough.</p>
    <p>Once all Mandazi are fried, sprinkle them with powdered sugar and enjoy!</p>
