      <h2>Kuli Kuli</h2>
      <p>Kuli Kuli are crunchy peanut-based snacks that are incredibly popular across Ghana and other parts of West Africa. Made from ground peanuts and spices, they're a tasty and nutritious alternative to chips or roasted nuts. These golden bites are perfect with a drink or as a quick snack any time of day.</p>
  
      <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>8 oz. salted, dry roasted peanuts</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground chili pepper</li>
        <li>Peanut oil (for frying)</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <p>Grind the peanuts and ginger together until smooth. Mix in the ground chili pepper and blend thoroughly. Squeeze the paste to extract as much oil as possible—this step is crucial for a crispy result. Shape the paste into about 20 pieces—sticks, small rings, or balls work great. If the mixture feels dry, add a couple tablespoons of water to help with shaping. Heat a deep pan of peanut oil and fry the kuli kuli on medium heat until they’re a nice golden brown. Drain on paper towels and serve warm or cooled.</p>

      <h2>Bofrot</h2>
      <p>Bofrot, sometimes called puff-puff, is a beloved Ghanaian treat that doubles as breakfast, dessert, or snack. These lightly sweetened, nutmeg-spiced dough balls are deep-fried until golden and fluffy. Bofrot is enjoyed plain or dressed up with toppings like powdered sugar or chocolate spread.</p>
  
      <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>4 2/3 cups (575g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup (200g) sugar, divided</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons nutmeg</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (1 packet) active dry or instant yeast</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 can (354ml) evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1¼ cups warm water (divided: ¾ cup, ¼ cup, ¼ cup)</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <p>If using active dry yeast, mix ¾ cup of warm water with a teaspoon of sugar and the yeast in a bowl. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy. In a large bowl, combine the flour, the rest of the sugar, salt, nutmeg, and instant yeast (if not using active dry yeast). Add the foamy yeast mixture, followed by evaporated milk. Mix the vanilla with ½ cup water and pour in, then stir to form a thick, stretchy batter. Traditionally mixed by hand, but a whisk or mixer works too. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for 2 hours until doubled in size.</p>
      <p>After rising, gently deflate the dough. Heat oil in a deep pot. Scoop small portions of dough (using your hand or an ice cream scoop) and carefully drop into the oil. Fry in batches, cooking each side for about 4–5 minutes or until golden brown all over. Turn continuously using a chopstick or skewer to ensure even browning. Serve warm with tea, porridge, or sweet toppings.</p>

      <h2>Hausa Koko</h2>
      <p>Hausa Koko is a warm, slightly sour porridge made from fermented corn or millet dough, infused with spices like ginger and cloves.

      <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>½ cup fermented corn or millet dough</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon hot chili powder</li>
        <li>Sugar to taste (optional)</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <p>Place the fermented dough in a pot and mix with 1 cup of cold water until smooth. Place over high heat and bring to a gentle simmer while stirring. Gradually add 2 cups of boiling water and continue stirring. Lumps may form—use a whisk to smooth them out. Stir in the salt, ground cloves, ginger, and chili powder. Let it simmer on low heat for about 10 minutes. Sweeten with sugar if desired, and serve hot.</p>

      </ul>
  
      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <p>Mix peanut butter with 1L of water, 1 tbsp tomato paste, 3 crushed scotch bonnets, and chopped onions. Cook over low-medium heat for ~20 minutes until thickened and oil appears. Add 3L of water to the mixture and strain into a large pot. Boil for 30 minutes, then simmer. Add whole tomatoes, 1 tbsp tomato paste, and 4 scotch bonnets. Steam chicken with ginger, half the blended onions, scotch bonnets, basil, and salt. Add chicken and broth to the soup. Blend tomatoes and scotch bonnets, strain, and return to pot.

      <h4>Tips</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Always cook cassava thoroughly—raw cassava is toxic.</li>
